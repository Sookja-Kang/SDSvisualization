```{r}
library(ggplot2)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FASLE)
```


```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(disp, mpg)) + geom_point()
```
Let's hide the library chunks
echo = FALSE or include = FALSE
```{r echo = FALSE}
{r include = FALSE}
```


include fuction hides both code and outcome
eval = FALSE --> shows only codes
echo = FALSE -->  no codes, only outcomes
